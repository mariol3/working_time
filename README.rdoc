== Working Time

This is a simple Ruby on Rails app to keep note of my working hours. I'm working
on this while I'm learning Rails so there will probably be lots of unbest pratices.
(Like plain password storage, ouch!) 

== TODO

- Stop store plain password in db and use a digest
- Add email verification
- Add "Export PDF" in WorkDay page
